# Stroke-Prediction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, 
responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. 
The purpose of this project was to use classification models to predict whether a given person had a stroke or not, 
and find the main risk factor for stroke to create a prediction system to predict the stroke in its early stages.
I worked with data provided by Kaggle, first I dealt with outliers and missing data, then I attempted to perform extensive data visualization, 
exploratory data analysis, feature Engineering, deal with imbalanced data, hyperparameter tuning of the model, 
and finally fit a model to make predictions on features.
